What I am trying to do? It's a wireless, Bluetooth controller for listening to music/general media playing in desktop. It allows me to control volume and skip tracks without pressing alt-tab or closing tab when I am doing another task. Unlike standard macro pads/controller, this can rotary encoder for volume and an integrated LCD screen.
